WELCOME TO BLACKJACK.

----------Introduction---------

Blackjack is a card game consisting of a dealer and a number of players. This program is a simulation of a real game.

- Each player is required to put up a bet ammount for the game to begin.
- The ammount cannot be more than you have.

The dealer will then match that ammount if you win.

GOAL - To get 21 , if not , as close as possible.

-----------Card Values----------

- 2 through 10: Face value (e.g., a 5 is 5 points).
- Jack, Queen, King: 10 points.
- Ace: Can be 1 or 11 points, whichever benefits the hand more. A hand with an Ace valued as 11 is called a "soft" hand. 

-------------Rules-------------

1) The Dealer deals each player two cards face up and two cards to themself, one face down
    - BLACKJACK : If your first two cards are an Ace and a 10-value card, you have a "Blackjack" 
    - You typically win one and a half times your bet (3:2 payout), provided the dealer doesn't also have Blackjack.

2) Based on the number the player is given they have the ability to Hit or Stand
    - Hit is the term for drawing a new card on top of the 2 you have already been dealt.
    - Stand is the term for satisfaction with the cards you have been dealt.

3) When the player(s) is satisfied with the number they have been dealt they will stand on that number.
    - No longer able to withdraw from bet after standing

4) Dealer's Turn: After all players finish their turns, the dealer reveals their face-down card. 
    - The dealer must follow strict rules: they must hit on a hand total of 16 or less and must stand on a total of 17 or more.

5) Payouts: Hands are compared.
    - If the dealer busts, all remaining players win an amount equal to their bet (even money).
    - If the dealer does not bust, the higher hand wins even money.
    - A tie (called a "PUSH"") means no money is won or lost; the bet is returned. 

------------Why?-------------

    - This is a simplifed simulation of a BLACKJACK experience

    - It is meant to educate new players without the use of internet or real money

    - This simualtion is based on the ground rules and does not inhernet the many implications such as 
        - Withdrawing half the bet
        - Blackjack earns 3:2 of bet ammount

- This simuation acts as an end to the Fall 2025 Semester.

- Implementing all of the things I have learned throughout the semester.
